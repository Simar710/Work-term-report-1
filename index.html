                    <p>During my summer co-op at Camis Inc. as a software developer, my main tasks were to create test
                        scenarios, make test plans and execute them. I was a part project from beginning to end. It was
                        called 'Rental Dashboard'.
                        In this website, I explained about my employer, my goals and job description. At the end, I
                        highlighted the details explained in the website.

            </div>
            <p>For more than 40 years, Camis has offered government-run parks, marinas, and harbours reservation and
                park management systems.
                Camis reservation systems have developed over the course of four decades, moving from phone calls and
                paper lists to the powerful, feature-rich software solutions you see today. There are different teams
                such as product squad, development squad, QA team, insight squad, etc. I was the part of insight squad.
                My team had 7 members. During my co-op term, my manager got changed, but I was able to get adjusted to
                the sudden changes that were made by new manager. My team was very supportive and helplfull. Everyone
                was determined to complete the task on time with utmost precision.

                <p>

                <div>Data management, business logic, and user interfaces are just a few of the areas that Developer
                    Co-ops are expected to contribute to in the development of Camis software. I was a part of a major
                    project from beginning to the end. I am proud that the project started with my work and also ended
                    with my work. There was a lot of brainstroming and working with other team members was involved. The
                    project was called 'Rental Dashboard'. This project's motive was to display information related to
                    the rentals bought in the separate Dashboard. It had different requirements depending on the client
                    it was made for. I created test scenarios, made test plans and executed them. Apart from this I
                    worked with different 'Billing Reports'. It was very senistive work as billing reports are used to
                    calculate the commission earned by Camis from its clients. So I had to test and create each and
                    every scenario very carefully.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Essential Functions:</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>60% Operational Work</strong> <br>
                    Program maintenance is the process of recreating, identifying, and resolving errors in any Camis
                    software.
                    Keeping up with unit tests as needed. Responding to bug reports and tickets,
                    aiding in product design evaluations. To do my job, I made use of applications including JIRA,
                    Tableau, Slack, Confluence, SQL Server, and TestCafe.<br>
                    <strong>35% Product Road Map</strong> <br>
                    Add additional unit tests as well as new features, enhancements, and corrections to Camis apps.
                    The distribution of the tasks over the duration of my co-op term is seen in this percentage chart.
                    <br>
                    <strong>5% Active Participation</strong><br>
                    Actively participating as part of the software development team, including team meetings, testing,
                    park trips, and other duties as assigned by the project lead and/or reporting manager.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Challenges</strong>
                    Since the Developer Co-op will need to maintain expertise in a larger range of technologies than
                    others, this position requires a great deal of adaptability.

        <p class="newclass">It was a wonderfull experience to work at Camis Inc. There's a lot that I gained while
            working. First of all, I never knew that there's so much going on behind reserving a campsite. Before
            joining, I went through the job descriptiton, I found that there were a lot of opportunities to learn about
            testing and product review at Camis. I designed my goals keeping in my mind not only technical aspects of
            the job, but also business and interpersonal skills. My main tasks was to perform tests on different
            features. Due to different learning sessions and meeting, I was able to achieve my each and every goal.
            Apart from the technical skills, I get to know how to interact with clients and team members at a
            professional level. The experience that I gained at Camis will help me in honing my skills to the next
            level, which will eventually help me to fulfill my future goals.</p>
